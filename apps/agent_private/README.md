# agent_private

`agent_private` is the optional endpoint sensor for FortiDashboard labs. It is explicit, foreground-only and safe by default: commands print JSON unless `--post` is provided.

## Dry-Run Usage

```bash
cd apps/agent_private
uv run agent-private identity
uv run agent-private heartbeat --endpoint-id demo-endpoint-01
uv run agent-private process-snapshot --endpoint-id demo-endpoint-01
uv run agent-private connection-snapshot --endpoint-id demo-endpoint-01
uv run agent-private simulate --endpoint-id demo-endpoint-01
```

## Posting Telemetry

Create an enrollment token through the FortiDashboard BFF, then send telemetry to the browser-facing API. The BFF forwards the enrollment token to `xdr_rico`; the agent does not need a browser session.

```bash
export AGENT_PRIVATE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
export AGENT_PRIVATE_ENDPOINT_ID=demo-endpoint-01
export AGENT_PRIVATE_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN=<token-returned-once>

uv run agent-private heartbeat --post
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:AGENT_PRIVATE_API_URL = "http://localhost:8000"
$env:AGENT_PRIVATE_ENDPOINT_ID = "demo-endpoint-01"
$env:AGENT_PRIVATE_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN = "<token-returned-once>"

uv run agent-private heartbeat --post
```

## Safety Notes

- No persistence, daemon install, privilege escalation or remote command execution.
- Enrollment tokens are sent only as `Authorization: Bearer ...`.
- Process and connection snapshots may include usernames, process names and remote IPs; use only in authorized labs.
- Keep dry-run mode for demos unless the SOC stack is running and the token is scoped to the lab endpoint.
